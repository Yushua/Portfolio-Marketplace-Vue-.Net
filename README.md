the purpose is to sell your items and to have someone else on another acount buy it on react/nestjs
you can switch between the types and it shoudl show you a different website layout based on your limitations

dont' overdo the design. ther are only a couple of pages to be made

- buy item (shows all items currently being sold)
- settings
- set new type
- show all items owned

jsut filter what pages you can't or can't share. and do that. from the backend you have the names, in the frontend the location to.
when you login or refresh the page. it filters all these pages ONCE and then makes the browserpage.

search option for an item


very simple. settings is to change your name. you don't have unique names.

a logout button.
